    <section class="bio">
      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an early-career cybersecurity / network security learner who takes a lab-first approach. I build small
        environments, break things safely, and validate fixes with Wireshark and Splunk. I recently completed the
        Certificate IV in Cyber Security at TAFE NSW (St Leonards, June 2025) and I’m continuing to study while growing
        my portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I lack in experience, I make up for in discipline, curiosity, and follow-through. My approach is simple:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Learn the concept,</li>
        <li>Build a small lab,</li>
        <li>Test it until I understand it,</li>
        <li>Document what works and why.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="skills">
      <h2>Recent Focus</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Setting up segmented networks and firewall rules in my VirtualBox lab (pfSense, Kali, Windows)</li>
        <li>Practicing recon → enumeration → exploitation workflows safely, and capturing evidence</li>
        <li>Running Packet Tracer labs to strengthen fundamentals (VLANs, routing basics, ACLs, WLAN)</li>
        <li>Studying Cisco NetAcad content to tighten my networking theory</li>
        <li>Self-paced CEH exam preparation</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="certifications">
      <h2>How I’d Add Value in a Junior Role</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reliable execution:</strong> give me a runbook or a ticket and I’ll work through it carefully, ask
          clear questions, and close the loop.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence-driven:</strong> I screenshot, capture packets, and annotate configs so others can follow
          my steps.</li>
        <li><strong>Security mindset:</strong> least privilege, change safely, verify results, and roll back cleanly.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Continuous learning:</strong> I schedule regular study blocks and treat feedback as fuel.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="goals">
      <h2>What I’m Looking For</h2>
      <p>
        A junior Cybersecurity / Network Security / Network Engineer opportunity where I can learn from experienced
        engineers, contribute on real tasks, and grow into a dependable team member. If you’re open to someone who’s
        hungry to learn and ready to prove it, I’d love to talk.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks for reading, and for the opportunity to earn it.</p>
