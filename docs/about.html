      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an early-career cybersecurity / network security learner who takes a lab-first approach. I build small environments, break things safely, and validate fixes with Wireshark and Splunk. I recently completed the Certificate IV in Cyber Security at TAFE NSW (St Leonards, June 2025) and I’m continuing to study while growing my portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I lack in experience, I make up for in discipline, curiosity, and follow-through. My approach is simple:

        <ol>
          <li>learn the concept,</li>
          <li>build a small lab,</li>
          <li>test it until I understand it,</li>
          <li>document what works and why.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="skills">
      <h2>Recent focus</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Setting up segmented networks and firewall rules in my VirtualBox lab (pfSense, Kali, Windows)</li>
        <li>Practicing recon → enumeration → exploitation workflows safely, and capturing evidence</li>
        <li>Running Packet Tracer labs to strengthen fundamentals (VLANs, routing basics, ACLs, WLAN)</li>
        <li>Studying Cisco NetAcad content to tighten my networking theory</li>
        <li>Self-paced CEH Exam preparation</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>How I’d add value in a junior role</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Reliable execution:</b> give me a runbook or a ticket and I’ll work through it carefully, ask clear questions, and close the loop.</li>
        <li><b>Evidence-driven:</b> I screenshot, capture packets, and annotate configs so others can follow my steps.</li>
        <li><b>Security mindset:</b> least privilege, change safely, verify results, and roll back cleanly.</li>
        <li><b>Continuous learning:</b> I schedule regular study blocks and treat feedback as fuel.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="certifications">
      <h2>What I’m looking for</h2>
      <p>
        A junior Cybersecurity / Network Security / Network Engineer opportunity where I can learn from experienced engineers, contribute on real tasks, and grow into a dependable team member. If you’re open to someone who’s hungry to learn and ready to prove it, I’d love to talk. <br><br>
        Thanks for reading, and for the opportunity to earn it.
