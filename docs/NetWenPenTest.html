    <h2>🌐🔒 Network Web Penetration Testing</h2>
    <h4>Objective</h4>
    <p>
      The purpose of this lab exercise was to configure Windows Defender Firewall rules in order to allow ICMP (ping) traffic for troubleshooting network connectivity between devices. Instead of disabling the firewall, which would expose the system to unnecessary risks, a new rule was created to permit ICMP requests temporarily. After successful testing, the rule was removed to restore the firewall’s secure configuration.
