        <h1>üåêüîí Network Web Penetration Testing</h1>
        <p>
            The purpose of this lab exercise was to configure Windows Defender Firewall rules in order to allow ICMP
            (ping) traffic for troubleshooting network connectivity between devices. Instead of disabling the firewall,
            which would expose the system to unnecessary risks, a new rule was created to permit ICMP requests
            temporarily. After successful testing, the rule was removed to restore the firewall‚Äôs secure configuration.
        </p>

        <h3>Lab Setup, Configuration & Initial Validation</h3>
        <p>
            I set up a safe, repeatable lab in Hyper-V. I created an Internal virtual switch, gave my host a static IP
            on the lab subnet, and attached the VM to that switch during creation. Then I checked configuration and
            connectivity with ipconfig, ping, and tracert, confirmed the web target was listening with nmap, and
            captured baseline traffic with Wireshark. The lab was isolated, predictable, and ready for web pentesting.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Create an isolated lab switch in Hyper-V</b>: Opened Virtual Switch Manager and created an Internal
                virtual switch. An Internal switch isolates the lab from the internet while letting the host talk to
                VMs‚Äîperfect for safe testing.

        <h3>Discovery & Testing (port scans, sniffing, scripting)</h3>
        <p>
            Before I ran any active tests I established clear scope and permission for my isolated Hyper-V lab and
            confirmed the environment was safe to test. I performed reconnaissance and non-intrusive scans (Nmap,
            Wireshark) to map services and collect evidence, logging every command and result so my work is repeatable
            and accountable.
        </p>

            <li>
                <figure>
                    <b>Netcat (nc)</b> ‚Äî I used nc -nv 192.168.0.50 1-50 to quickly verify the first 50 TCP ports and

        <h3>2 Basic Scripting & Programming Languages</h3>
        <p>
            I applied two scripting/programming languages to automate and enhance my penetration testing process:
            <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Bash</strong>. Python was used to interact with Nmap modules and parse
            structured scan data, while Bash was used for quick automation of repetitive network commands and log creation.
        </p>
        
        <figure>
            <img class="screenshot"

                alt="Python script using python-nmap to enumerate open ports and display structured results.">
            <figcaption>
                Python script using the <code>python-nmap</code> module to automate scanning and organize results by host and
                service.

        </figure>
        
        <figure>
            <img class="screenshot"

                alt="Python terminal output displaying parsed Nmap results with product and version details.">

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>
            Bash scripts were used to simplify recon and logging. Simple one-liners like <code>for ip in $(cat hosts.txt); do nmap -sS $ip -oN scan_$ip.txt; done</code> made repeatable batch scans easy and traceable.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Scripts for Testing Tools</h3>
        <p>
            I created helper scripts for testing tools such as <strong>Nmap</strong>, <strong>Netcat</strong>, and <strong>HTTP          enumeration</strong>. These scripts automate scans, discovery, and evidence collection for consistent testing.
        </p>

            These scripting and automation practices improved the consistency and traceability of my web penetration testing,
            ensuring repeatable results and clear documentation.

        <h3>Identify Vulnerabilities and Implement Base-Level Troubleshooting</h3>
        <p>
            Following the reconnaissance and scripting phases, I focused on identifying service vulnerabilities and applying
            troubleshooting steps aligned with standard lab guidelines. Using <strong>Nmap</strong>, <strong>Telnet</strong>,
            and controlled exploit modules, I validated real service exposures and demonstrated secure remediation practices
            within my isolated environment.

                Exploit verification through <strong>Telnet</strong> to port 6200 confirms the backdoor behavior in this
                version.
                The shell returned <em>root</em> access, confirming the vulnerability under controlled conditions.

                The exploit README provides usage syntax and confirms that the exploit was designed for
                <code>vsFTPd 2.3.4</code>,
                ensuring version-matched testing and controlled execution.

            <figcaption>
                The controlled exploit execution demonstrated successful command execution as <strong>root</strong> within the
                sandboxed lab. This reinforces the need for secure patching and service hardening.

                Post-remediation check confirms the vulnerable service was patched and port 6200 was closed. Network scans now
                show
                reduced attack surface and improved security posture.

            These findings demonstrate secure lab-based testing procedures for identifying exploitable versions,
            validating vulnerabilities ethically, and implementing proper troubleshooting through controlled isolation
            and patch verification.
