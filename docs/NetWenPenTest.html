    <h2>üåêüîí Network Web Penetration Testing</h2>
    <h4>Objective</h4>
    <p>
      The purpose of this lab exercise was to configure Windows Defender Firewall rules in order to allow ICMP (ping) traffic for troubleshooting network connectivity between devices. Instead of disabling the firewall, which would expose the system to unnecessary risks, a new rule was created to permit ICMP requests temporarily. After successful testing, the rule was removed to restore the firewall‚Äôs secure configuration.

        <h3>Lab Setup, Configuration & Initial Validation</h3>
        <p>
            I set up a safe, repeatable lab in Hyper-V. I created an Internal virtual switch, gave my host a static IP on the lab subnet, and attached the VM to that switch during creation. Then I checked configuration and connectivity with ipconfig, ping, and tracert, confirmed the web target was listening with nmap, and captured baseline traffic with Wireshark. The lab was isolated, predictable, and ready for web pentesting.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Create an isolated lab switch in Hyper-V</b>: Opened Virtual Switch Manager and created an Internal virtual switch. An   Internal switch isolates the lab from the internet while letting the host talk to VMs‚Äîperfect for safe testing.

            <li>
                <b>Give the host a static IP on the lab network</b>: In Network Connections ‚Üí Ethernet (the new Hyper-V virtual adapter), I set IPv4 to a static address (e.g., 192.168.0.1/24). The host becomes the ‚Äúmanagement jump point‚Äù and a predictable gateway for tools and file sharing.

            <li>
                <b>Attach the VM to the internal switch</b>: While creating the VM, I chose the Connection = my internal switch (e.g., CertIV_Cyber_Int_Switch_C1). This guarantees the VM is placed on the isolated lab network from first boot.

                <b>Prove L2/L3 connectivity inside the lab</b>: I ran ipconfig to verify addresses, Ran ping 192.168.0.105 and got replies (0% loss), Ran tracert 192.168.0.105 and saw a single hop‚Äîdirect on the internal network. Confirms addressing, ARP resolution, and that hosts can reach each other before any web testing.
