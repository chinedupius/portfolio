        <h4>Configure the routers</h4>
        <ol>
            <li> <b>üè∑Ô∏èName Routers:</b> Gave each router a clear hostname (R1 and R2), but in a real world environment, I‚Äôd use a proper naming convention like location and role (e.g., SYD-HQ-B1-R1 for Sydney HQ, Building 1, Router 1, or SYD-PLM-HR-R2 for Sydney Plumpton, HR, Router 2). Clear names make monitoring, audits, and on-call fixes much faster.

                </figure>
            </li>
            <li> <b>üîêSecuring device access (console, VTY, AUX):</b> To protect the router‚Äôs management paths, I configured authentication on the console, VTY (remote), and AUX lines. Each line was given its own password, and I enforced SSH-only for remote sessions. I also set an encrypted enable secret for privileged mode. This will prevent unauthorized access.

            </li>

            <li>
                <b>üë• Role-Based Access Control with AAA & RADIUS:</b> I implemented AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) to secure router access and integrated it with a RADIUS server for centralized user authentication. Instead of relying only on local accounts, I enforced login policies that check users against the RADIUS database. <br><br>
                
                I created dedicated accounts for:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>HR_Manager (Matthew)</b> ‚Üí authenticated via RADIUS with HR privileges
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Finance_Manager (Luke)</b> ‚Üí authenticated via RADIUS with Finance privileges
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Each user‚Äôs role determines the level of access they receive. I also configured a local fallback account for emergency access if the RADIUS server is unavailable.

                <p>
                    This setup ensures least privilege access and centralized identity management. When someone changes roles or leaves the organization, disabling them on the RADIUS server instantly cuts their access to all network devices ‚Äî no need to touch every router manually.
                </p>

                    <h3>üñß Router Configuration ‚Äì Overall Achievement</h3>
                    In this stage of the project, I was able to fully configure and secure both routers (R1 and R2) to reflect real-world enterprise practices. I started by giving each router a clear hostname, which makes device management and troubleshooting easier. From there, I enforced strong security on all access methods, including the console, VTY, and AUX ports, ensuring that every management entry point required authentication. <br> <br>

                    On R1, I went a step further by enabling SSH with RSA key generation and AAA authentication, replacing insecure Telnet sessions with encrypted remote access. This setup guaranteed that only authorized users could log in, and that all remote management traffic was protected. On R2, I configured AAA local authentication, allowing role-based access for different users while still keeping the device secure. <br> <br>

                    The end result is that both routers are not only configured for functionality but also hardened against unauthorized access. This demonstrates my ability to apply security best practices in router management, combining local user authentication with centralized AAA and secure remote login through SSH.

            <h3>üåê WLAN Configuration</h3>
            <p>
                I configured the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC), Access Point (AP), DHCP/DNS server, and end-user devices. The WLC was given a management IP so it could control APs, and I created two WLANs, a secure Staff SSID using WPA2-PSK and an open Guest SSID. The DHCP server was set to automatically assign addresses, default gateways, and DNS, while the AP registered with the WLC and started broadcasting both SSIDs. <br><br>

                I tested the setup by connecting a laptop to the Staff network and verified traffic flows using Wireshark. The topology confirmed everything was working together, from routers and switches to wireless docss, simulating how a secure enterprise WLAN operates.
            </p>

            <li>

            <p>
                In this section, i successfully deployed and configured a Squid proxy server to filter web traffic, enforce access control, and block restricted websites. This demonstrated my ability to manage network security, traffic filtering, and endpoint protection in a practical lab environment.

            <h3>Configure a VPN Server</h3>
            <p>
                By completing these steps, I successfully configured a site-to-site and dial-in VPN server, tested encrypted tunnels, and validated connectivity using both ping tests and secure authentication. This demonstrates my ability to implement VPN infrastructure for secure remote access and inter-site communication.

                <b>Testing Connectivity with Ping (Before VPN):</b> I attempted to ping the remote subnet 10.10.20.10 from the docs machine. The request timed out, confirming that connectivity was not yet possible without the VPN tunnel. This serves as a baseline test before enabling the VPN.

            <h3>Configure a VPN Server</h3>
            <p>
                I successfully configured a site-to-site and dial-in VPN server, tested encrypted tunnels, and validated connectivity using both ping tests and secure authentication. This demonstrates my ability to implement VPN infrastructure for secure remote access and inter-site communication.

            <li>
                <b>Configuring VPN Properties:</b> I started by opening the VPN server properties in the Routing and Remote Access Manager. Here, I configured the authentication provider, accounting provider, and SSL certificate binding to ensure secure encrypted tunnels for remote access. This step ensures that only authenticated users can connect.
