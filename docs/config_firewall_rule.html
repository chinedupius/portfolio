    <h2>🔥Configuring Firewall Settings and Adding New Rules</h2>
    <h4>Objective</h4>
    <p>
      The purpose of this lab exercise was to configure Windows Defender Firewall rules in order to allow ICMP (ping) traffic for troubleshooting network connectivity between devices. Instead of disabling the firewall, which would expose the system to unnecessary risks, a new rule was created to permit ICMP requests temporarily. After successful testing, the rule was removed to restore the firewall’s secure configuration.
    </p>

    <h3>🔧 Tools & Environment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Operating System: Windows 11</li>
      <li>Firewall Utility: Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security</li>
      <li>Command Line: Windows Command Prompt (ping tests)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📌 Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Verify Ping Test Before Rule:</b>

      </li><br>
      <li><b>Set Action and Profile:</b>

      <li><b>Verify with Ping Test:</b>

      </li><br>
      <li><b>Remove Rule After Testing:</b>

        <img class="firewall_img" src="assets/images/Firewall Configuration/Confirmed Deletion.png" alt="Delete Confirmed">

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The ICMP rule allowed successful pings between devices.</li>
        <li>Once deleted, the firewall reverted to its secure default state.</li>
        <li>Demonstrated good practice: enabling rules temporarily rather than disabling the firewall entirely.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        This lab reinforced the importance of secure firewall management. By adding a temporary inbound rule for ICMP traffic, I was able to troubleshoot connectivity issues effectively while maintaining system security. The exercise highlighted how proper rule configuration can balance security and functionality in real-world network environments.
